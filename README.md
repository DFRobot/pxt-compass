## Summary
The CMPS11 is our 3rd generation tilt compensated compass. Employing a 3-axis magnetometer, a 3-axis gyro and a 3-axis accelerometer. A Kalman filter combines the gyro and accelerometer to remove the errors caused by tilting of the PCB. The CMPS11 produces a result of 0-3599 representing 0-359.9 or 0 to 255. The output of the three sensors measuring x, y and z components of the magnetic field, together with the pitch and roll are used to calculate the bearing, each of these components are also made available in there raw form. The CMPS11 module requires a power supply at  3.6 - 5v and draws a nominal 25mA of current. A choice of  serial or I2C interfaces are provided.
